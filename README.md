# Lung_Cancer_ML

Our project, titled "Predictive Analytics for Early Lung Cancer Detection," aimed to develop machine learning models to predict lung cancer based on various patient-specific factors such as demographics, symptoms, and smoking history. The primary motivation was to create an accessible, cost-effective diagnostic alternative to traditional methods like CT imaging, which are expensive and often detect cancer at later stages.

We employed several machine learning models, including:

    1.Linear Support Vector Machine (Linear SVM)
    2.Decision Trees
    3.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    4.Logistic Regression

After thorough evaluation, the Linear SVM model emerged as the most effective, demonstrating perfect sensitivity and the highest Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.97. This model excelled in identifying all true positive cases, which is crucial for early cancer detection. Despite its limitation in specificity, the Linear SVM's high sensitivity and superior classification capability made it the best choice for this application. The project showcased the potential of machine learning techniques in enhancing early lung cancer detection and improving patient outcomes.
